# Movies-ETL

## Overview
This project asked me to create an SQL database with .csv & .json files imported into Python and ran through an ETL (extract, transform, load) process before uploading to the SQL database.  

## Results
The results were successful.  THe database exists with the full number of rows for each table and clean data within.  Below you can see the number of rows for the movies table, followed by the number of rows for the ratings table.

The data itself can be seen in Deliverable 3, which asked me to show the .head() function for each DataFrame after transforming the data.


## Summary
This was a successful project.  I was able to perform the ETL process and came up with the expected results.
